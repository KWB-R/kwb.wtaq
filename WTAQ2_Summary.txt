NAME
     wtaq - A computer program for calculating drawdowns and estimating 
            hydraulic properties for confined and water-table aquifers


ABSTRACT
     The computer program WTAQ calculates hydraulic-head drawdowns in a 
     confined or water-table aquifer that result from pumping at a well 
     of finite or infinitesimal diameter. The program is based on  
     analytical models of axial-symmetric groundwater flow in a homogeneous 
     and anisotropic aquifer developed by Moench (1997) and Mathias and
     Butler (2006). The program allows for well-bore storage and well-bore 
     skin at the pumped well and for delayed drawdown response at observation 
     wells or piezometers. For water-table aquifers, the program allows three
     options for simulating drainage from the unsaturated zone: instantaneous
     drainage, gradual drainage, or drainage that explicitly accounts for
     hydraulic characteristics of the unsaturated zone (specifically, the 
     moisture retention and relative hydraulic conductivity of the soil). 
     WTAQ calculates dimensionless or dimensional theoretical drawdowns that 
     can be used with measured drawdowns at observation points to estimate 
     the hydraulic properties of confined and water-table aquifers.


METHOD
     Program WTAQ implements the Laplace-transform solutions for drawdown 
     at a pumped well, observation well, or observation piezometer that
     are given in equations 18-27 and 30-31 in Moench (1997) and equation 42
     in Mathias and Butler (2006). The Laplace-transform solutions are 
     numerically inverted to the time domain by means of either the Stehfest 
     (1970) or de Hoog (1982) algorithms. The program calculates dimensionless 
     or dimensional drawdowns for a given set of input conditions that are 
     specified by the user in a data-input file.


HISTORY

     WTAQ version 2.1 06/29/2012 - Minor bug fix to allow code to run when
        SIGMA is specified as 0 (for confined aquifers); previous versions
        stopped, with an error message, if SIGMA was specified as 0. 

     WTAQ version 2.0 04/29/2011 - Added analytical model of Mathias and 
        Butler (2006) for improved representation of drainage to water-
        table aquifers from the unsaturated zone.


     WTAQ version 1.2 04/29/2011 - Minor bug fix to variable name IOWS. 

     WTAQ version 1.1 11/13/2009 - Improved internal checks for incorrect
        data values. 

     WTAQ version 1.0 10/01/1999 - Initial release.


DATA REQUIREMENTS
     To use WTAQ, the user must prepare a data-input file that contains
     information on the type of aquifer being simulated (confined or water 
     table), hydraulic properties of the aquifer, characteristics of the pumped
     well and of all observation wells and(or) observation piezometers at 
     which drawdowns will be calculated, and additional information for model
     solution. Input-data requirements are explained in the documentation
     reports by Barlow and Moench (1999 and 2011).


OUTPUT OPTIONS

     Primary output is drawdown calculated as a function of time at the pumped
     well and at up to 25 observation-well and(or) observation-piezometer
     locations. A result file and plot file are generated by the program. The
     result file contains detailed information on the model simulation,
     whereas the plot file contains an abbreviated listing of model results
     that can be used for graphing.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     WTAQ is written in Fortran 77. Input and result file names are queried by
     the program and read from the screen. The program also can be run in
     batch mode by redirecting program execution from the screen to a batch
     file that contains the names of the input and output files.
